      <p>
        Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to

        Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if
        they are accessible through our Services.
      </p>

      <h6>In this Privacy Policy:</h6>

      <ul>
        <li>We’ll refer to our website as the “Site”.</li>
        <li>We’ll refer to iXi Inc. as iXi or “we” or “us” or “our”.</li>
        <li>We’ll refer to all the products and services we provide individually and collectively, as the “Services”.</li>
        <li>We’ll refer to you, the person or entity accessing our Site or using our Services, as “you” or “your” or (if you are a purchaser of our Services, our “customer”).</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Some other definitions we’ll be using in this Privacy Policy</h6>

      <p>
        <strong>What is a Data Controller?</strong> For general data protection regulation purposes, the “Data
        Controller” means the organization who decides the purposes for which and the way in which any personal data is
        processed. Our customers are the Data Controllers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What is a Data Processor?</strong> A “Data Processor” is an organization which processes Personal
        Information for a Data Controller. We are the Data Processor for our customers. As a Data Processor, we are
        bound by the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (the “GDPR”).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What is Data Processing?</strong> Data processing is any operation or set of operations performed upon

      </p>

      <h6>Do we use cookies?</h6>

      <p>
        Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive
        through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you
        have a registered account, associate it with your registered account. We may use both session Cookies and
        persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact
        with our Site. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate
        data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the
        future. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to
        customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off
        from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change
        your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please
        note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the
        Site or the Services. We may also collect information via standard server logs or clear GIFs (also known as
        “Web beacons”). If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal
        Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we

      <h6>Who at iXi may access your Personal Information?</h6>

      <p>
        Designated members of our staff may access Personal Information to help our customers with any questions they
        have, including help using the product, investigating security issues, or following up on bug fixes with the
        customer. This activity is logged in our system for compliance, and we maintain different levels of access for
        its employees depending on their role in our company.
      </p>

      <h6>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h6>

      <p>
        Except as set out below, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personal
        Information. Non-personally identifiable visitor information, however, may be provided to other parties for
        marketing, advertising, or other uses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Customers belong to organizations on iXi and may invite other team members. Team members will have
        access to the organization’s data (including Personal Information) that we process on behalf of the Data
        Controller. Each customer can designate team administrators who can control who has access to the Personal
        Information.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may disclose Personal Information to third-party service providers (for example, payment processing and
        data storage and processing facilities) that assist us in our work. We limit the Personal Information provided
        to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we
        require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such Personal Information.
        We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors.
        These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us
        conduct and improve our business.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may also release your Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law,
        enforce our site policies, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your Personal Information may also be transferred to another company in the event of a transfer, change of
        ownership, reorganization or assignment of all or part of our businesses or assets. This will occur if the
        parties have entered into an agreement under which the collection, use and disclosure of the information is
        limited to those purposes of the business transaction, including a determination whether or not to proceed
        with the business transaction. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our websites for thirty
        (30) days of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal Information or as otherwise may be
        required or permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h6>How do we handle global transfers and process of your Personal Information?</h6>

      <p>
        Although we welcome people from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you
        happen to use our services, your Personal Information may be shared. This means that we may collect your
        Personal Information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries
        outside of where you live. For example, some of our third-party providers may be located in different countries.
        Where this is the case, we will take steps to make sure the right security measures are taken so that your
        privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy. By submitting your Personal
        Information, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. If we transfer your Personal Information
        from the E.U. and process it in the United States, we do so in accordance with applicable law. With respect
        to information received or transferred, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal
        Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to
        lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
        We will not transfer your Personal Information outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) unless it takes
        such measures as are necessary to provide adequate protection for such Personal Information consistent with the
        requirements of applicable laws. To the extent that we process (or causes to be processed) any Personal
        Information originating from the EEA in a country that has not been designated by the European Commission as
        providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information, the Personal Information shall be deemed to
        have adequate protection (within the meaning of EU Data Protection Legislation) by virtue of the European
        Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries, whereby you will
        be regarded as the Data Exporter and we will be regarded as the Data Importer. In the event that the Contractual
        Clauses are deemed to no longer be a valid mechanism to legitimize transfers of personal data outside the
        European Economic Area, we will amend this Policy in order to establish a legitimate transfer of personal data
        outside the European Economic Area.
      </p>

      <h6>Principle of Onward Transfer</h6>

      <p>
        In the context of an onward transfer of data to a third party, we have responsibility for the processing of
        Personal Data we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. We shall
        remain liable under applicable law if our agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with
        applicable law, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
      </p>

      <h6>Retention of your Personal Information</h6>

      <p>
        We retain your Personal Information for as long as we need to fulfill our Services. In addition:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We may keep data linked to cookies and other online identifiers up to three years.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we are involved in litigation or a governmental or regulatory investigation, then we keep data throughout
          the period of litigation or investigation and for 5 years after that. If a settlement means that we have
          to keep data for longer, then we keep data for the period required to administer the settlement. If we provide
          data to law enforcement agencies, then we keep a record of this for one year beyond the end of the
          investigation.
        </li>
      </ul>
